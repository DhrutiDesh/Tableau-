Created a Financial Consumer Complaints Dashboard designed for business use, enabling teams to monitor complaint volumes and analyze category-wise trends effectively. This dashboard empowers employees to make informed, data-driven decisions by assessing key performance indicators (KPIs). Inspired by the work of Gandes Goldestan, the dashboard features dynamic, user-friendly interactivity â€” including a date range selector at the top-right corner. Upon selection, both the map and charts respond instantly, offering an insightful and engaging data exploration experience.
